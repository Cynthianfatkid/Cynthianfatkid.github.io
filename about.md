Hej! I am a Cybersecurity Analyst and Security Researcher based in Copenhagen, Denmark. I completed my MSc in Cybersecurity at Aalborg University, Denmark in June 2024. My main interests include Detection Engineering, Threat Intelligence, Network Security Monitoring, Defensive Security Research, and Malware Analysis.

My work focuses on building and improving detection capabilities by combining network visibility, attacker behaviour analysis, and real-world telemetry. I’ve worked with honeypots and security monitoring workflows to better understand adversary activity, and I enjoy translating those observations into practical detection logic and actionable insights.

I’ve also contributed to the European defence project SESIOP, where I worked on security research and published a paper as part of the project’s work. Through this, I gained hands on experience applying security research in a high-trust, real-world context, with a strong emphasis on reliability, operational security, and detection driven outcomes.

I’m especially interested in detection that is practical, explainable, and resilient against evasion, including building tools and rules using technologies like Zeek. Alongside this, I enjoy designing CTF challenges to create realistic scenarios that strengthen defensive thinking. If you’d like to connect or collaborate, feel free to reach out.
