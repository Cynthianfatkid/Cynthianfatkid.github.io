Blue-team Cybersecurity Analyst focused on detection engineering, incident response, and defensive automation.

### What I’m into
- Building detections that are *testable* and *tunable*
- Turning manual IR steps into repeatable playbooks
- Creating labs that produce useful telemetry and realistic scenarios
